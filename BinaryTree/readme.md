# What is Binary Tree?

  *Hierarchical Data Structure*

â€¢ *Topmost element is known as the root of tree.*

. *Every node can have at most 2 children in binary tree.*

. *Can't access elements randomly using index*

*Eg: File system hierarchy*

### **Common traversal methods:**

o *preorder(root): print-left-right*

o *postorder(root) : left-right-print*

o *inorder (root) : left-print-right*

## **Adavtages**

-Can represent data with some relationship

-insertion and search are much more efficient.

## **Disadvantages**
-Sorting is difficult

-Not much Fixible

# **What is Binary Search Tree**
> Binary tree with the additional restriction

>restriction:

   > Left child must always be root node
   
   > Right Child must always be greater than root node.
   
> Insertion Deletion Search is much more efficient than binary tree   

## **Application**

>Suitable for sorted hierarchical

## Advantages
>Can represent data with some relationship
> Insertion and search are much more efficient

## Disadvantages

>Sorting is difficult
>Not much flexible
